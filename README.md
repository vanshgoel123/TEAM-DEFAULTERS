Scam Message and Call Detection System
Overview
This project addresses the increasing issue of digital financial scams. Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), our system detects suspicious messages and calls in real-time, alerting users to potential scam activity. Designed to prevent financial losses, this system leverages text and voice analysis to provide a secure, user-friendly solution.

Features
Scam Message Detection: Analyzes messages to detect scams and provides real-time warnings.
Fake Call Detection: Monitors calls for suspicious language patterns, sending alerts if fraudulent behavior is detected.
User Interface Integration: Alerts are delivered directly within the messaging platform for seamless user experience.
Technologies Used
Languages: Python
Libraries:
pandas, numpy for data handling and preprocessing
nltk for NLP tasks
scipy for data transformation
sklearn, imblearn for machine learning model training and evaluation
optuna for hyperparameter optimization
matplotlib for data visualization
Machine Learning Models: RandomForest, XGBoost, SVM, Voting Classifier
Methodology
The project consists of three main phases:

Data Collection and Preprocessing

Messages are categorized as either "Normal" or "Scam".
Data cleaning (e.g., removal of null values, stop words) is performed to optimize model training.
Model Training

Several ML models (RandomForest, XGBoost, SVM) are trained and optimized to ensure high accuracy.
Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using Optuna to maximize model performance.
User Interface Integration

The trained model is integrated into a user-friendly interface.
The system sends alerts through the messaging platform, notifying users of potential scams in real-time.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scam-detection-system.git
cd scam-detection-system
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure nltk stopwords are downloaded:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Use the provided script to load and preprocess message data.

python
Copy code
python data_preprocessing.py
Model Training: Run the model training script to train and save the model.

python
Copy code
python train_model.py
Real-Time Detection: Use the main application to analyze messages and calls in real-time.

python
Copy code
python run_app.py
Results
The system provides high accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate and scam messages. Testing results include:

Message Detection Accuracy: Achieved optimal accuracy by utilizing a Voting Classifier.
Probability Visualization: Graphs visualize the probability of each message being a scam.
